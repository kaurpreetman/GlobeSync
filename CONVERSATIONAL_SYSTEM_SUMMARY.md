## 🧠 Core Components

### 1. **Conversation Manager** (`conversation_manager.py`)
- **Context Tracking**: Maintains conversation state across sessions
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies preferences, constraints, budget mentions
- **Phase Management**: Handles different conversation stages
- **Question Generation**: Creates contextual follow-up questions

### 2. **Chat Orchestrator** (`chat_api.py`)
- **Agent Integration**: Calls travel agents based on conversation context
- **WebSocket Management**: Real-time chat communication
- **Intelligent Triggers**: Decides when to call agents vs continue conversation
- **Recommendation Engine**: Combines agent data into actionable insights

### 3. **API Integration** (added to `api.py`)
- **WebSocket Endpoints**: `/chat/{user_id}` for real-time communication
- **Session Management**: Initialize, context retrieval, finalization
- **RESTful Fallbacks**: HTTP endpoints for non-real-time operations

### 4. **Frontend Demo** (`chat-demo.html`)
- **Basic Info Form**: Collects initial trip parameters
- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket-powered conversation interface
- **Suggested Responses**: Quick-tap options for better UX
- **Visual Feedback**: Typing indicators, message animations
- **Action Buttons**: Finalize itinerary, calendar sync, start over

## 🎯 Conversation Flow Examples

### **Example 1: Art & Food Lover**

```
🤖: "Great! A 7-day trip to Paris in June for 2 adults with a $3000 budget. 
     What type of experiences are you most excited about?"

👤: "We love art and food!"

🤖: "Perfect! I'm checking the weather for June... ☀️ Great news! 
     June is ideal with 20-25°C temperatures and minimal rain.
     
     For art lovers, Paris has incredible options:
     • Louvre Museum (advance booking recommended)
     • Musée d'Orsay for Impressionist masterpieces  
     • Picasso Museum in the Marais
     
     And for food experiences:
     • Seine river dinner cruise
     • Cooking class in Montmartre
     • Food market tours
     
     Should I focus on museum passes or more hands-on culinary experiences?"

👤: "Both! But maybe more hands-on food experiences"

🤖: "Excellent choice! I'm finding cooking classes and food tours...
     ✅ Found 3 cooking classes with great reviews
     ✅ Located wine tasting experiences in historic cellars
     ✅ Discovered local food markets with guided tours
     
     For timing, would you prefer:
     - Morning food tours + afternoon museums
     - Full-day culinary experiences + evening museum visits
     - Mix throughout the week?"
```

### **Example 2: Weather-Based Recommendations**

```
🤖: "I've checked the weather for your London trip in March...
     ⚠️ There's a 70% chance of rain during your visit. 
     
     Should I prioritize indoor attractions like:
     • British Museum & Tate Modern
     • West End theater shows  
     • Covered markets (Borough, Camden)
     • Indoor food halls and pubs
     
     Or would you prefer a mix with backup indoor options?"

👤: "A mix sounds good, but I don't mind rain"

🤖: "Love the adventurous spirit! 🌧️ 
     Here's what I recommend:
     
     ☔ Rain-friendly activities:
     • Hyde Park walk with nearby museum backup
     • Thames river cruise (covered boats available)
     • Covent Garden (covered market area)
     
     🏠 Indoor highlights:
     • Churchill War Rooms (fascinating history)
     • Sky Garden (amazing city views, free but book ahead)
     • Traditional pub experiences
     
     I'll also find you a good umbrella shop! 😄"

```python
context = {
    "basic_info": {"city": "Paris", "budget": 3000, ...},
    "preferences": {"activity_types": ["art", "food"], ...},
    "agent_data": {"weather": {...}, "events": {...}},
    "conversation_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
    "current_phase": "preference_gathering"
}
```

### **3. Real-time WebSocket Communication**
- Instant message delivery
- Typing indicators
- Connection management

start chat-demo.html
# or
http://localhost:8000/docs  # For API testing
```

### **3. Test Flow**
1. **Basic Info**: Enter destination, dates, budget
2. **Chat Begins**: AI asks about preferences
